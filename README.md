# 100-word-stories

Repo for a BBC News Hack project, 100 word stories. 

Utilises the AMP stories sliding functionality but adds a additional slide up article wrapper which has the story compacted into 100 words. This then has an optional button to read the full article to to transition back to the inital carousel. Also once on the article there is a easy transition back to the carousel. 

We think that this would engage younger audiences as it's mobile driven using slide/swipe funtionality that is common across apps such as tinder, instagram and snapchat. This format also allows the user to digest "snackable" content without the worry of them being 500 words and 5 mins into a story they don't actually find interesting or relevant, which they only visited because it had a click bait title. 

The idea allowing a compact news experience as well as smooth transitions into the full articles but also back from articles to the more compact experience.
